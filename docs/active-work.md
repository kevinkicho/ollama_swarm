## Release 1.0 (Tier A) — foundation + product/Brain expansion

See **`docs/RELEASE-1.0-PLAN.md`** and **`docs/BRAIN-OS-FOR-EXTERNAL-AGENTS.md`**.

- [x] Phases 0–7 foundation (security optional for single-user WIP)
- [x] Product: Simple vs Advanced presets; default blackboard; always `/runs/:id`
- [x] Reliability: pending-commit reaper; per-run stop debounce tests; outcome banner
- [x] Architecture: typed unified `createRunner`; V2 mid-flight phase prefer
- [x] Eval: preset-coverage gate across all modes; analysis tasks require rubric
- [x] Brain: control-surface API + CLI (say/drain/list/summary/control-surface)
- [ ] Optional: live Core scoreboard regen; split routes/swarm.ts further

## Queued: Run-start stability (P1)

See **`docs/plans/run-start-stability.md`** for full PR breakdown.

- [x] **PR1** — Unified `mergeTranscriptEntry` helper (hydrate + append dedup parity)
- [x] **PR2** — `SwarmStoreProvider` WS buffer + gate history fallback (fix false `stopped` phase)

## Queued: Project growth + knowledge graph (P2)

See **`docs/plans/project-growth-knowledge-graph.md`** for full PR breakdown.

- [x] **PR2** — `.swarm/project-graph.json` sidecar + incremental merge
- [x] **PR3** — Agent context injection + recovery hints on drift
- [x] **PR4** — ConformanceMonitor v2 (anchor overlap + UI tooltip)
